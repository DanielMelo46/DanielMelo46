## 💡 About Me

I'm a results-driven professional with experience in building scalable ETL pipelines, automating reporting workflows, and developing cloud-based data solutions.\
I’m passionate about what I like to call "code power", especially when it comes to data that can solve real-world (even those we consider small day-to-day time savers) problems when treated properly.

🔎 **Currently seeking opportunities** in:

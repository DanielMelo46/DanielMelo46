I'm a professional passionate about building scalable ETL pipelines, automating workflows (making people's lives easier), and developing cloud-based solutions.\
I‚Äôm passionate about what I like to call "code power", especially when it comes to data that can solve real-world (even those we consider small day-to-day time savers) problems when treated properly.

These are the tools I love:

**Languages:**\
`Python` `SQL` `Java (OOP)` `Bash`\
**ETL / Automation:**\
`AWS Glue` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn`\
**Cloud and Infrastructure:**\
`AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, Athena, DynamoDB, IoT Core)` `Docker` `IaC`\
**Data Visualization and Reporting:**\
`Power BI` `Amazon QuickSight` `Plotly` `Dash`\
**Additional:**\
`Git and GitHub` `Jira` `MongoDB` `Excel (Advanced)`


This is a space reserved as a **get-to-know-me** for what I LOVE to do, and I really appreciate your visit :)
